1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,330
Today I want to talk about design,

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,330
but not design as we usually think about it.

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,330
I want to talk about what is happening now

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,330
in our scientific, biotechnological culture,

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,330
where, for really the first time in history,

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,330
we have the power to design bodies,

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,330
to design animal bodies,

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,330
to design human bodies.

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,330
In the history of our planet,

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,330
there have been three great waves of evolution.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,330
The first wave of evolution

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,330
is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,330
So, as you all know,

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,330
species lived in particular ecological niches

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,330
and particular environments,

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,330
and the pressures of those environments

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,330
selected which changes,

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,330
through random mutation in species,

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,330
were going to be preserved.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,330
Then human beings stepped out

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,330
of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,330
and created the second great wave of evolution,

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,330
which was we changed the environment

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,330
in which we evolved.

25
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,330
We altered our ecological niche

26
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,330
by creating civilization.

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,330
And that has been the second great --

28
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,330
couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --

29
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,330
flow of our evolution.

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,330
By changing our environment,

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,330
we put new pressures

32
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,330
on our bodies to evolve.

33
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,330
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,

34
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,330
all the way through modern medicine,

35
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,330
we have changed our own evolution.

36
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,330
Now we're entering a third great wave

37
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,330
of evolutionary history,

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,330
which has been called many things:

39
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,330
"intentional evolution,"

40
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,330
"evolution by design" --

41
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,330
very different than intelligent design --

42
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,330
whereby we are actually now

43
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,330
intentionally designing and altering

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,330
the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,330
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that

46
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,330
and then at the end talk a little bit

47
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,330
about what some of the implications are for us

48
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,330
and for our species, as well as our cultures,

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,330
because of this change.

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,330
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,330
We started selectively breeding animals

52
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,330
many, many thousands of years ago.

53
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,330
And if you think of dogs for example,

54
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,330
dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,330
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,330
Dogs are the result

57
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,330
of selectively breeding traits that we like.

58
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,330
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days

59
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,330
by choosing offspring that looked a particular way

60
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,330
and then breeding them.

61
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,330
We don't have to do it that way anymore.

62
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,330
This is a beefalo.

63
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,330
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.

64
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,330
And they are now making them,

65
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,330
and someday, perhaps pretty soon,

66
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,330
you will have beefalo patties

67
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,330
in your local supermarket.

68
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,330
This is a geep,

69
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,330
a goat-sheep hybrid.

70
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,330
The scientists that made this cute little creature

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,330
ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.

72
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,330
I think they said it tasted like chicken.

73
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,330
This is a cama.

74
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,330
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,

75
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,330
created to try to get the hardiness of a camel

76
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,330
with some of the personality traits

77
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,330
of a llama.

78
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,330
And they are now using these in certain cultures.

79
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,330
Then there's the liger.

80
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,330
This is the largest cat in the world --

81
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,330
the lion-tiger hybrid.

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,330
It's bigger than a tiger.

83
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,330
And in the case of the liger,

84
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,330
there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.

85
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,330
But these were created by scientists

86
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,330
using both selective breeding and genetic technology.

87
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,330
And then finally, everybody's favorite,

88
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,330
the zorse.

89
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,330
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.

90
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,330
And so one of the things we've been doing

91
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,330
is using genetic enhancement,

92
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,330
or genetic manipulation,

93
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,330
of normal selective breeding

94
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,330
pushed a little bit through genetics.

95
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,330
And if that were all this was about,

96
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,330
then it would be an interesting thing.

97
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,330
But something much, much more powerful

98
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,330
is happening now.

99
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,330
These are normal mammalian cells

100
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,330
genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene

101
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,330
taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.

102
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,330
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.

103
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,330
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,

104
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,330
and put it into mammal cells.

105
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,330
These are normal cells.

106
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,330
And what you see here

107
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,330
is these cells glowing in the dark

108
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,330
under certain wavelengths of light.

109
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,330
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.

110
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,330
So they did it with mouse pups,

111
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,330
kittens.

112
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,330
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green

113
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,330
is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,

114
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,330
while this is from jellyfish.

115
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,330
They did it with pigs.

116
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,330
They did it with puppies.

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,330
And, in fact,

118
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,330
they did it with monkeys.

119
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,330
And if you can do it with monkeys --

120
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,330
though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate

121
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,330
is actually between monkeys and apes --

122
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,330
if they can do it in monkeys,

123
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,330
they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,

124
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,330
which means they can do it in human beings.

125
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,330
In other words, it is theoretically possible

126
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,330
that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable

127
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,330
of creating human beings

128
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,330
that glow in the dark.

129
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,330
Be easier to find us at night.

130
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,330
And in fact, right now in many states,

131
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,330
you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.

132
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,330
These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.

133
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,330
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered

134
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,330
to be yellow, green, red,

135
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,330
and they are actually available now in certain states.

136
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,330
Other states have banned them.

137
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,330
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.

138
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,330
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --

139
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,330
that controls genetically-engineered pets.

140
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,330
And so some states have decided to allow them,

141
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,330
some states have decided to ban them.

142
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,330
Some of you may have read

143
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,330
about the FDA's consideration right now

144
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,330
of genetically-engineered salmon.

145
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,330
The salmon on top

146
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,330
is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,

147
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,330
using a gene from these salmon

148
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,330
and from one other fish that we eat,

149
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,330
to make it grow much faster

150
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,330
using a lot less feed.

151
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,330
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision

152
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,330
on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --

153
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,330
it'll be sold in the stores.

154
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,330
And before you get too worried about it,

155
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,330
here in the United States,

156
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,330
the majority of food you buy in the supermarket

157
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,330
already has genetically-modified components to it.

158
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,330
So even as we worry about it,

159
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,330
we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --

160
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,330
without any regulation,

161
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,330
and even without any identification on the package.

162
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,330
These are all the first cloned animals

163
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,330
of their type.

164
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,330
So in the lower right here,

165
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,330
you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep --

166
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,330
now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;

167
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,330
Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat;

168
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,330
CC the cat, for cloned cat;

169
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,330
Snuppy, the first cloned dog --

170
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,330
Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy --

171
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,330
created in South Korea

172
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,330
by the very same man that some of you may remember

173
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,330
had to end up resigning in disgrace

174
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,330
because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.

175
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,330
He actually was the first person

176
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,330
to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,

177
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,330
because dog genomes are very plastic.

178
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,330
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.

179
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,330
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,

180
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,330
a real "gold ring" of cloning,

181
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,330
because there are many horses that win important races

182
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,330
who are geldings.

183
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,330
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud

184
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,330
has been removed.

185
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,330
But if you can clone that horse,

186
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,330
you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race

187
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,330
and his identical genetic duplicate

188
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,330
can then be put out to stud.

189
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,330
These were the first cloned calves,

190
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,330
the first cloned grey wolves,

191
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,330
and then, finally,

192
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,330
the first cloned piglets:

193
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,330
Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.

194
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,330
(Laughter)

195
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,330
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology

196
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,330
to try to save endangered species.

197
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,330
This is the use of animals now

198
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,330
to create drugs and other things in their bodies

199
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,330
that we want to create.

200
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,330
So with antithrombin in that goat --

201
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,330
that goat has been genetically modified

202
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,330
so that the molecules of its milk

203
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,330
actually include the molecule of antithrombin

204
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,330
that GTC Genetics wants to create.

205
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,330
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,

206
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,330
from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,

207
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,330
are pigs that they are going to use, in fact,

208
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,330
to try to create all kinds of drugs

209
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,330
and other industrial types of chemicals

210
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,330
that they want the blood and the milk

211
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,330
of these animals

212
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,330
to produce for them,

213
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,330
instead of producing them in an industrial way.

214
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,330
These are two creatures

215
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,330
that were created

216
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,330
in order to save endangered species.

217
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,330
The guar

218
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,330
is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.

219
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,330
A somatic cell, a body cell,

220
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,330
was taken from its body,

221
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,330
gestated in the ovum of a cow,

222
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,330
and then that cow gave birth to a guar.

223
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,330
Same thing happened with the mouflon,

224
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,330
where it's an endangered species of sheep.

225
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,330
It was gestated in a regular sheep body,

226
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,330
which actually raises an interesting biological problem.

227
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,330
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.

228
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,330
We have our nucleic DNA

229
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,330
that everybody thinks of as our DNA,

230
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,330
but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,

231
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,330
which are the energy packets of the cell.

232
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,330
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.

233
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,330
So really, what you end up having here

234
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,330
is not a guar and not a mouflon,

235
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,330
but a guar

236
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,330
with cow mitochondria,

237
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,330
and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,

238
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,330
and a mouflon with another species of sheep's

239
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,330
mitochondrial DNA.

240
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,330
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.

241
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,330
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species

242
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,330
in the age of biotechnology --

243
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,330
a question that we're not really sure yet

244
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,330
how to solve.

245
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,330
This lovely creature

246
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,330
is an Asian cockroach.

247
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,330
And what they've done here

248
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,330
is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain

249
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,330
and then a transmitter on top,

250
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,330
and it's on a big computer tracking ball.

251
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,330
And now, using a joystick,

252
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,330
they can send this creature

253
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,330
around the lab

254
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,330
and control whether it goes left or right,

255
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,330
forwards or backwards.

256
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,330
They've created a kind of insect bot,

257
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,330
or bugbot.

258
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,330
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.

259
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,330
This actually is one of DARPA's very important --

260
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,330
DARPA is the Defense Research Agency --

261
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,330
one of their projects.

262
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,330
These goliath beetles

263
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,330
are wired in their wings.

264
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,330
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,

265
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,330
and they can fly these creatures around the lab.

266
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,330
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.

267
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,330
They can't actually make them land.

268
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,330
They put them about one inch above the ground,

269
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,330
and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.

270
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,330
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.

271
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,330
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed

272
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,330
that this creature --

273
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,330
this is a moth --

274
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,330
this is the moth in its pupa stage,

275
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,330
and that's when they put the wires in

276
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,330
and they put in the computer technology,

277
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,330
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,

278
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,330
it is already prewired.

279
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,330
The wires are already in its body,

280
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,330
and they can just hook it up to their technology,

281
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,330
and now they've got these bugbots

282
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,330
that they can send out for surveillance.

283
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,330
They can put little cameras on them

284
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,330
and perhaps someday deliver

285
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,330
other kinds of ordinance

286
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,330
to warzones.

287
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,330
It's not just insects.

288
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,330
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat

289
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,330
by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.

290
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,330
Again, it's got technology --

291
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,330
it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;

292
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,330
it's got a camera on top of its head.

293
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,330
The scientists can make this creature

294
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,330
go left, right.

295
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,330
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.

296
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,330
They've now created an organic robot.

297
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,330
The graduate students

298
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,330
in Sanjiv Talwar's lab

299
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,330
said, "Is this ethical?

300
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,330
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."

301
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,330
I'll get back to that in a minute.

302
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,330
There's also been work done with monkeys.

303
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,330
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.

304
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,330
He took owl monkeys,

305
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,330
wired them up

306
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,330
so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,

307
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,330
especially looking at the movement of their right arm.

308
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,330
The computer learned what the monkey brain did

309
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,330
to move its arm in various ways.

310
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,330
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,

311
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,330
which you see here in the picture,

312
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,330
put the arm in another room.

313
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,330
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,

314
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,330
to make that arm in the other room

315
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,330
do whatever the monkey's arm did.

316
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,330
Then he put a video monitor

317
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,330
in the monkey's cage

318
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,330
that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,

319
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,330
and the monkey got fascinated.

320
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,330
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,

321
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,330
this prosthetic arm would do.

322
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,330
And eventually she was moving it and moving it,

323
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,330
and eventually stopped moving her right arm

324
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,330
and, staring at the screen,

325
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,330
could move the prosthetic arm in the other room

326
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,330
only with her brainwaves --

327
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,330
which means that monkey

328
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,330
became the first primate in the history of the world

329
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,330
to have three independent functional arms.

330
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,330
And it's not just technology

331
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,330
that we're putting into animals.

332
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,330
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.

333
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,330
He took 20,000 and then 60,000

334
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,330
disaggregated rat neurons --

335
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,330
so these are just individual neurons from rats --

336
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,330
put them on a chip.

337
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,330
They self-aggregated into a network,

338
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,330
became an integrated chip.

339
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,330
And he used that

340
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,330
as the IT piece

341
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,330
of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.

342
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,330
So now we have organic computer chips

343
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,330
made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.

344
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,330
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern

345
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,330
took a completely intact,

346
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,330
independent lamprey eel brain.

347
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,330
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.

348
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,330
It is living --

349
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,330
fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium

350
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,330
with these electrodes going off to the sides,

351
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,330
attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,

352
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,330
put it into a cart --

353
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,330
here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --

354
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,330
and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,

355
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,330
when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,

356
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,330
the cart moves toward the light;

357
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,330
when you turn it off, it moves away.

358
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,330
It's photophilic.

359
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,330
So now we have a complete

360
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,330
living lamprey eel brain.

361
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,330
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,

362
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,330
sitting there in its nutrient medium?

363
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,330
I don't know,

364
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,330
but in fact it is a fully living brain

365
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,330
that we have managed to keep alive

366
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,330
to do our bidding.

367
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,330
So, we are now at the stage

368
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,330
where we are creating creatures

369
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,330
for our own purposes.

370
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,330
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti

371
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,330
of the University of Massachusetts.

372
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,330
He altered this mouse

373
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,330
so that it was genetically engineered

374
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,330
to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,

375
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,330
put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it

376
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,330
and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse

377
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,330
and transplanted onto a human being.

378
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,330
Genetic engineering

379
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,330
coupled with polymer physiotechnology

380
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,330
coupled with xenotransplantation.

381
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,330
This is where we are in this process.

382
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,330
Finally, not that long ago,

383
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,330
Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,

384
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,330
where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,

385
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,330
which is a machine,

386
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,330
created an artificial genome,

387
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,330
put it in a different cell --

388
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,330
the genome was not of the cell he put it in --

389
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,330
and that cell then reproduced

390
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,330
as the other cell.

391
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,330
In other words,

392
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,330
that was the first creature in the history of the world

393
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,330
that had a computer as its parent --

394
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,330
it did not have an organic parent.

395
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,330
And so, asks The Economist:

396
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,330
"The first artificial organism and its consequences."

397
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,330
So you may have thought

398
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,330
that the creation of life

399
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,330
was going to happen in something that looked like that.

400
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,330
(Laughter)

401
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,330
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

402
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,330
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

403
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,330
This is a DNA synthesizer,

404
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,330
and here at the bottom

405
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,330
are just bottles of A, T, C and G --

406
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,330
the four chemicals

407
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,330
that make up our DNA chain.

408
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,330
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.

409
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,330
For the first time in the history of this planet,

410
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,330
we are able to directly design organisms.

411
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,330
We can manipulate the plasmas of life

412
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,330
with unprecedented power,

413
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,330
and it confers on us a responsibility.

414
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,330
Is everything okay?

415
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,330
Is it okay to manipulate and create

416
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,330
whatever creatures we want?

417
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,330
Do we have free reign

418
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,330
to design animals?

419
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,330
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us

420
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,330
and say, "Look, I want a dog.

421
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,330
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,

422
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,330
the body of a retriever,

423
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,330
maybe some pink fur,

424
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,330
and let's make it glow in the dark"?

425
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,330
Does industry get to create creatures

426
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,330
who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva

427
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,330
and other bodily fluids,

428
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,330
create the drugs and industrial molecules we want

429
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,330
and then warehouse them

430
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,330
as organic manufacturing machines?

431
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,330
Do we get to create organic robots,

432
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,330
where we remove the autonomy from these animals

433
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,330
and turn them just into our playthings?

434
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,330
And then the final step of this,

435
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,330
once we perfect these technologies in animals

436
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,330
and we start using them in human beings,

437
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,330
what are the ethical guidelines

438
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,330
that we will use then?

439
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,330
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.

440
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,330
We are not only already using these things in animals,

441
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,330
some of them we're already beginning to use

442
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,330
on our own bodies.

443
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,330
We are now taking control of our own evolution.

444
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,330
We are directly designing

445
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,330
the future of the species of this planet.

446
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,330
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility

447
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,330
that is not just the responsibility

448
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,330
of the scientists and the ethicists

449
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,330
who are thinking about it and writing about it now.

450
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,330
It is the responsibility of everybody

451
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,330
because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies

452
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,330
we will have in the future.

453
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,330
Thanks.

454
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,330
(Applause)
